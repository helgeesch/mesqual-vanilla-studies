# Studies & Examples

This repository includes hands-on study examples that demonstrate the MESQUAL framework from different angles.

---

## Study 01 — Intro to MESQUAL

A **step-by-step tutorial** that introduces the core modules and concepts of the MESQUAL framework.
Each notebook walks through a specific subsystem — data fetching, KPI computation, visualization, interpreter development — at a deliberate pace, so you can build a solid understanding of how the pieces fit together.

Start here if you want to **learn the framework** from the ground up.

## Study 02 — PyPSA-EUR Example

A **concrete, real-world use case** built on PyPSA-EUR that shows the daily MESQUAL workflow in practice.
It includes the full project structure — setup scripts, source code, custom interpreters, and analysis scripts — mirroring how an actual study is organized and executed.

Start here if you want to **see how MESQUAL is used in practice**.
